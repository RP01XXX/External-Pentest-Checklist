# External-Pentest-Checklist
This is a cheat sheet to help teach pentesters how to perform external assessments. I am training and as I grow I will continue to change this document. Please send me input to add to this checklist!

My Process:
- I run all of these tools in a bash script found in my repositories. This script runs the majority of tools I need and exports to a folder.

1. Enumerate all subdomains of a company to identify the IP ranges for scanning. I will often pair this with Assetfinder, mxtoolbox, sublist3r and the others to see if other things populate.
2. Run a port scan of all the IP's from above to identify live hosts and ports. 
3. Run a specific NMAP scan to identify services on target hosts.
4. Run a Nessus scan on the live hosts, this often doesnt populate target vectors but it has occassionaly identified exploits that let me get into an enviornment.
5. Identify all websites and run directory tests to look for misconfigured and public files, login pages, anything of interest. 
6. Identify employee emails and breached passwords.These may be usefull in attempting to access resources discovered.
7. Once everything has been enumerated from above you can start exploiting!
